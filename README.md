# ws-server

A websocket server I implemented from scratch using node.js. I started this project because I was curious and wanted to know what it would take to to implement the websocket protocol. At the moment, I have sated my curiosity but will continue developing it when possible (clean up mostly).

If you are interested in learning more about websockets, I recommend you read the spec [(rfc6455)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6455/?include_text=1) and [MSDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_servers) guide to building a websocket server.
